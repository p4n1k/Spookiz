He may seem cold-blooded and evil, but he actually wants to get close to others and become their friends. He has OCD and a complete neat freak! You may see him and his sidekick KongKong get up to no good, but he's a good soul really!\n\nFrankie is a bit of a dull slowpoke, Frankie's appetite sometimes turns him into a bit of a monster! He grows a four-leaf clover on top of his head which is lucky charm. He's one of the kindest members of the Spookiz gang, but his appetite sometimes puts him in a foul mood if he is not full up!\n\nKebi is a free-minded soul and isn't one to stick to rules and formality. He's constantly energetic and bubbly and loves to tease Cula as much as he can. It is a friendly rivalry though as they truly are best buddies!\n\nKongKong is Cula's sidekick KongKong is best described as weak to the strong and strong to the weak. He's very self conscious about his short height but by listening and trusting in Cula he feels safe and comforted.\n\nZizi shows gives off a stinking odour but she does not realise it. Body parts (mainly her head) often fall apart off her body, but are always easily placed back together on her. She has a secret crush on Cula and dreams of being with him always. She's incredibly shy around him and doesn't like anyone to know this.\n\n► Visit our Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/spookizworld\n► Visit Our Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/spookizworld\n► Brought to you by Keyring Studios: http://www.keyringstudio.com\n\n#spookiz #spookizcartoon #spookizepisodes #kidscartoons #spookizmovie","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EUn_q8wP944/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EUn_q8wP944/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EUn_q8wP944/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EUn_q8wP944/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EUn_q8wP944/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Spookiz - Cartoons for Everyone","playlistId":"UUGRODP7wtTU_uyNZmu9cb7g","position":561,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"EUn_q8wP944"}},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"EUn_q8wP944","videoPublishedAt":"2017-12-15T11:00:03Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"tlUWDXILc-uluIA2czPMXugDUd0","id":"VVVHUk9EUDd3dFRVX3V5TlptdTljYjdnLlJwRld5Yk1IMXdZ","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2017-12-14T11:00:04Z","channelId":"UCGRODP7wtTU_uyNZmu9cb7g","title":"Funny Animated Cartoon | Spookiz | 💔 Nobody Loves Me 💔 | 스푸키즈 | Cartoon For Children","description":"► Discover the Spookiz range: https://teespring.com/stores/spookizworld\n► Click here to watch more Spookiz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-roWIF7Jbp4&list=PLjFmi1u8peSqfuNF_6MNZAtEoE7iyVOwF\n\n► Watch Season 3 episodes: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjFmi1u8peSpacOD85ZcXhMODLJjj8GJ9\n\n► Watch Spookiz Cookie: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjFmi1u8peSqHr464an2LU9i64uGgXBAz\n\n► Watch Season 1 Episodes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1Mfx1lSUB8&list=PLjFmi1u8peSri7CAohLtWs7f10m6H8K6q\n\n► Watch Season 2 Episodes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xlqBei_djs&list=PLjFmi1u8peSod4nYslcV6xelUuiUo_WCk\n\nSpookiz 스푸키즈 is a Keyring animation, which follows the lives of Cula, Frankie and all their friends whilst at school. \n\nCula is a descendant of a royal Dracula family.

You may see him and his sidekick KongKong get up to no good, but he's a good soul really!\n\nFrankie is a bit of a dull slowpoke, Frankie's appetite sometimes turns him into a bit of a monster! He grows a four-leaf clover on top of his head which is lucky charm. He's one of the kindest members of the Spookiz gang, but his appetite sometimes puts him in a foul mood if he is not full up!\n\nKebi is a free-minded soul and isn't one to stick to rules and formality. He's constantly energetic and bubbly and loves to tease Cula as much as he can. It is a friendly rivalry though as they truly are best buddies!\n\nKongKong is Cula's sidekick KongKong is best described as weak to the strong and strong to the weak. He's very self conscious about his short height but by listening and trusting in Cula he feels safe and comforted.\n\nZizi shows gives off a stinking odour but she does not realise it. Body parts (mainly her head) often fall apart off her body, but are always easily placed back together on her. She has a secret crush on Cula and dreams of being with him always. She's incredibly shy around him and doesn't like anyone to know this.\n\n► Visit our Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/spookizworld\n► Visit Our Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/spookizworld\n► Brought to you by Keyring Studios: http://www.keyringstudio.com\n\n#spookiz #spookizcartoon #spookizepisodes #kidscartoons #spookizmovie","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sJVo-o-gjjg/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sJVo-o-gjjg/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sJVo-o-gjjg/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sJVo-o-gjjg/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sJVo-o-gjjg/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"channelTitle":"Spookiz - Cartoons for Everyone","playlistId":"UUGRODP7wtTU_uyNZmu9cb7g","position":872,"resourceId":{"kind":"youtube#video","videoId":"sJVo-o-gjjg"}},"contentDetails":{"videoId":"sJVo-o-gjjg","videoPublishedAt":"2015-10-30T15:00:01Z"}},{"kind":"youtube#playlistItem","etag":"HEXDeZCTxvFOP7g-R6pIwXJwzfs","id":"VVVHUk9EUDd3dFRVX3V5TlptdTljYjdnLmV0QWFfS0JNQzFR","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2015-10-22T08:25:01Z","channelId":"UCGRODP7wtTU_uyNZmu9cb7g","title":"Spookiz | 117 - PE Class (Season 1 - Episode 17) | Videos For Kids 스푸키즈","description":"► Discover the Spookiz range: https://teespring.com/stores/spookizworld\n► Click here to watch more Spookiz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-roWIF7Jbp4&list=PLjFmi1u8peSqfuNF_6MNZAtEoE7iyVOwF\n\n► Watch Season 3 episodes: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjFmi1u8peSpacOD85ZcXhMODLJjj8GJ9\n\n► Watch Spookiz Cookie: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjFmi1u8peSqHr464an2LU9i64uGgXBAz\n\n► Watch Season 1 Episodes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1Mfx1lSUB8&list=PLjFmi1u8peSri7CAohLtWs7f10m6H8K6q\n\n► Watch Season 2 Episodes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xlqBei_djs&list=PLjFmi1u8peSod4nYslcV6xelUuiUo_WCk\n\nSpookiz 스푸키즈 is a Keyring animation, which follows the lives of Cula, Frankie and all their friends whilst at school. \n\nCula is a descendant of a royal Dracula family.
